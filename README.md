This repository is for developing the image processing part for the Hexapod robot.

There are 2 directories one is for the actual program working and the other one is for testing different components.

The main development will be done in the src folder. Here are 2 files. trained_detector.py is the one which detects person the best.
The other one is detecting persons which are not persons.

The trained detector program uses a trained model to compare with the captured images.
